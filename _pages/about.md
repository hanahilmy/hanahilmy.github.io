My name is Hana Ibrahim and I'm a data scientist that loves researching. I'm interested in working on multimodal ML, unsupervised learning, explainable AI and new exciting AI research. I am a highly analytical person and I love reading as well. I have previously primarily worked on computer vision, image processing, explainable AI, process analytics and AI in production processes.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on kaggle competitions and research.</p>
